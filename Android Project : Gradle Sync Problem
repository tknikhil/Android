For some reason Android Studio didn't set the gradle version by default  may be this one of the reason that I was getting 
Android Project :sync faliure problem 
It was the step by step process and time cosuming process but in the end I solve it

First thing first check the language in which you are going to create the project Android Studio provides two language 
Kotlin and Java By default it was on Kotlin.

Second thing set ANDROID GRADLE PUGIN VERSION and GRADLE VERSION
File-->Project Structure-->change Android Gradle Plugin Version (you will find plugin version and its compatible gradle version in
https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/gradle-plugin)and Gradle Version.

Third thing just for conformation go to
File--> Setting-->Build,Exicution,Deployment-->project level settings-->select Use Default gradle wrapper
and if in Global Gradle Setting offline work was checked unchecked that.

And if it Still gives problem 
Remove .gradle folder as much as you can create new Project it will again generate .gradle folder with fresh dependices file 

this is how I solve my Problem if it still gives error try and try eventually you will find Solutiin

Happy Coding :)
